        <h1>Greenhouse Emissions in Sectors in relation to GDP</h1>
        <p>To find the relationship between GDP and Pollutants, we also have to look at the sectors that contribute to these pollutants. Most well developed countries have many
            sectors that emit a large amount of greenhouse gases, but we have to understand which sector contributes to this cause the most. This is so we can understand the correlation
            between what sector emits the most and the trend of the emissions compared to GDP as well as pollution.</p>

        <h6>Graph of Greenhouse Emissions to Sector Emissions by Country</h6>
        <div class='my-5'></div>
        
        <p>Generally, countries with high levels of industrialization and energy production tend to have higher total greenhouse gas emissions. 
           In this graph, countries like the United States and China are among the largest emitters of greenhouse gases globally due to their significant industrial activities 
            and high energy consumption. It also seems that emissions for Land-Use Change and Forestry are not the highest in most of the countries, except for countries like India and the Congo.</p>
        <p>This would mean that sectors other than the manufacturing and energy sectors do not have high emissions in most countries.
            To understand the correlation between the sector and the GDP per capita of the country, we have to also compare it to the population size to understand if the amount of emissions also depends on how many people live in that country.
            We have to find the trend between the higher concentrations of emissions to population and GDP per capita.</p>

        <iframe id="igraph" scrolling="no" style="border:none;" seamless="seamless" src="https://L31421.github.io/ComputingProject/chart_gdp_sector.html" height="525" width="100%"></iframe>
        <h6>Graph of Sector Emissions to GDP by Country</h6>
        
        <div class='my-5'></div>
        <p>In general, countries with higher levels of GDP tend to have higher levels of greenhouse gas emissions due to the increased demand for energy and goods.
            This is because economic growth is often associated with increased industrialization, transportation, and energy consumption, all of which contribute to greenhouse gas emissions.
            There is a correlation between population, GDP, and emissions as it seems that the higher the population, the more emissions that is needed to supply economic growth, especially in electricity and agriculture.</p>
        
        <p>As these has shown, there seems to be a positive correlation between the amount of pollution to GDP, which we have thought otherwise.
            Countries also seem to prioritize more on electricity and transportation rather than agriculture or forestry in a higher population. </p>
